As a Mission Systems Division Intern at the Hume Center for National Security and Technology, I've had the extraordinary opportunity to work on **UtProSat**, a cube satellite that will deploy on Blue Origin's **New Glenn 2nd Launch**. This project represents the culmination of years of engineering effort and showcases the practical application of space systems engineering.

## Project Overview

UtProSat is a CubeSat mission that demonstrates advanced satellite technology capabilities. Working on this project has given me hands-on experience with real space hardware that will soon be orbiting Earth.

## My Contributions

### Ground Station to Payload Communication

I implemented the critical communication systems that enable:

- **Bidirectional data flow** between ground control and the satellite
- **Reliable protocol handling** for space-to-ground communications  
- **Error detection and correction** for data integrity in the harsh space environment
- **Command and control interfaces** for mission operators

### Experiment Scheduling Systems

Developed sophisticated scheduling software to manage:

- **Automated experiment execution** based on orbital parameters
- **Resource allocation** for power, processing, and data storage
- **Priority-based task management** for competing mission objectives
- **Timeline optimization** to maximize scientific return

### Safe Data Storage

Implemented robust data storage solutions featuring:

- **Redundant storage systems** to prevent data loss
- **Data integrity verification** using checksums and error correction
- **Efficient compression algorithms** to maximize storage capacity
- **Secure data handling** protocols for sensitive experiment results

### System Recovery and Fault Tolerance

Designed and implemented critical system recovery capabilities:

- **Autonomous fault detection** and system diagnostics
- **Graceful degradation** strategies when systems fail
- **Automatic recovery procedures** for common failure modes
- **Safe mode operations** to preserve mission-critical functions
- **Watchdog systems** to detect and recover from software failures

## Technical Challenges

### Space Environment Considerations

Working on satellite systems requires addressing unique challenges:

- **Radiation hardening** to protect against cosmic rays
- **Temperature cycling** from extreme cold to hot
- **Power management** with limited solar panel capacity
- **Communication delays** and intermittent ground contact

### Real-Time Systems

The satellite operates as a real-time system where:

- **Timing is critical** for successful operations
- **Deterministic behavior** is essential for mission success
- **Resource constraints** require careful optimization
- **Failure tolerance** must be built into every subsystem

## Blue Origin New Glenn Integration

Being part of a mission launching on Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket adds additional excitement:

- **Commercial space integration** with cutting-edge launch systems
- **Rigorous testing standards** to ensure launch compatibility
- **Deployment mechanisms** designed for the New Glenn payload bay
- **Mission timeline coordination** with launch schedule requirements

## Skills and Technologies Applied

This project has allowed me to apply and develop expertise in:

- **Embedded systems programming** for space-qualified hardware
- **Real-time operating systems** and scheduling algorithms
- **Communication protocols** for space applications
- **System architecture design** for fault-tolerant systems
- **Testing and validation** for space-qualified systems

## Mission Impact

UtProSat represents more than just a technical achievementâ€”it's a stepping stone toward more advanced satellite missions. The systems I've developed will:

- **Demonstrate autonomous operation** capabilities
- **Validate new technologies** for future missions  
- **Provide valuable flight heritage** for subsequent projects
- **Enable scientific research** from low Earth orbit

Working on UtProSat has been an incredible opportunity to contribute to actual space hardware that will soon be operating in orbit. The experience has reinforced my passion for space systems and provided invaluable experience with the rigorous engineering standards required for successful space missions.

The upcoming launch on Blue Origin's New Glenn will be the ultimate test of our engineering work, and I'm excited to see UtProSat begin its mission in space.
