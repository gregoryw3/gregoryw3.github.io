During my internship at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD), I contributed to the development of next-generation autonomous systems for Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs). This experience provided invaluable insight into the intersection of naval engineering, autonomous systems, and modern software development practices.

## Project Overview

The project focused on developing autonomous capabilities for naval surface vessels, requiring:

- **Robust autonomous decision-making** in dynamic maritime environments
- **Real-time system performance** for safety-critical operations
- **Integration with existing naval systems** and protocols
- **Extensive testing and validation** for mission readiness

## Agile Development in Naval Context

### Methodology Implementation

Working with **Agile methodologies** in a defense context presented unique challenges:

- **Iterative development cycles** to rapidly incorporate feedback
- **Stakeholder collaboration** with naval operators and engineers
- **Incremental capability delivery** to demonstrate progress
- **Sprint-based feature development** with clear deliverables

### Stakeholder Communication

I authored clear and concise **BLUFs (Bottom Line Up Front)** for stakeholders to:

- **Ensure alignment** on project objectives and progress
- **Facilitate informed decision-making** at all organizational levels
- **Communicate technical concepts** to non-technical stakeholders
- **Maintain transparency** in development progress

## Technical Implementation

### Large-Scale Simulation

Conducted extensive testing using **large-scale simulation environments**:

- **Dynamic environment modeling** to simulate real-world conditions
- **System verification** under various operational scenarios
- **Performance benchmarking** against naval requirements
- **Risk assessment** for autonomous decision-making algorithms

### NEMA 2000 CAN Integration

Worked extensively with **NEMA 2000 CAN bus systems** for:

- **Marine electronics integration** following industry standards
- **Real-time data exchange** between vessel systems
- **Sensor data aggregation** from multiple maritime sensors
- **Command and control communication** with autonomous systems

### Parker PLC Systems

Integrated with **Parker Programmable Logic Controllers** to:

- **Control vehicle actuators** for steering and propulsion
- **Monitor system parameters** for operational status
- **Implement safety interlocks** for autonomous operations
- **Provide operator interfaces** for manual override capabilities

## System Architecture

### Communication Systems

Implemented robust communication capabilities:

- **Status reporting** to remote operators
- **Command reception** for mission updates
- **Data logging** for post-mission analysis
- **Emergency communication** for critical situations

## Challenges and Solutions

### Maritime Environment Complexity

Naval autonomous systems must handle:

- **Variable weather conditions** affecting sensor performance
- **Complex traffic patterns** with multiple vessel types
- **Regulatory compliance** with international maritime law
- **Security considerations** for naval applications

### Real-Time Performance Requirements

Critical system requirements included:

- **Low-latency response** to environmental changes
- **Deterministic behavior** for safety-critical decisions
- **Fault tolerance** for mission-critical operations
- **Graceful degradation** when systems fail

## Skills Developed

This internship significantly enhanced my expertise in:

- **Maritime systems engineering** and naval applications
- **Industrial communication protocols** (NEMA 2000, CAN)
- **PLC programming and integration** with autonomous systems
- **Agile project management** in defense contexts
- **System simulation and testing** methodologies
- **Working within multidisciplinary teams** of engineers, operators, and contractors

## Impact and Applications

The work on autonomous surface vessels has broad applications:

- **Naval operations** for reconnaissance and patrol missions
- **Maritime security** for port and harbor monitoring
- **Commercial shipping** for automated cargo operations
- **Scientific research** for oceanographic data collection

## Future Implications

Autonomous surface vessels represent a significant advancement in:

- **Naval capability enhancement** with reduced crew requirements
- **Maritime safety improvement** through automated collision avoidance
- **Operational cost reduction** for routine maritime tasks
- **Risk mitigation** for dangerous maritime missions

This experience at NSWCCD provided deep insight into the complexities of developing autonomous systems for real-world naval applications, combining cutting-edge technology with the rigorous reliability requirements of naval operations.
